## Getting Started

Make sure you are using Node.js version 18.17.0. Use nvm to switch with command:

```
nvm install 18.17.0
nvm use 18.17.0
```

Install and run the development client server:

```
npm i
npm run dev
```

Then run the server code. Look at the shadeform-backend README.

The client should be running on http://localhost:3000 and the server http://localhost:3001.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
